This is a graphic depicting the New York Times Upshot/Siena College polling data for California's 48th congressional district and how results varied between both age and geographic areas. Despite being among Californiaâ€™s more conservative congressional districts, a trend of liberalism still exists. For both location and age group, one category stood out as being the most liberal: across all locations, young voters (ages 18-34) were the most liberal, and across all age groups, Laguna Beach/South was more liberal than conservative.
